# 18/7/25 Frameworking rn?
As you probably saw in the readme. I'm making a framework! Irdk how im gonna do it, so I'm just gonna wing it and see how it goes

Okay, to begin with, I decided to search the dimentions of the laptop! I found it on the main website:

from there, I'll just create a sketch using rough estimates of everything

# Top Bit done!

I finished making the top bit of the framework laptop! This was the Easiest bit in this whole thing, making the logo on the top of the laptop was the difficult part, but overall, it took me 2 hours, not that shabby!

# Done even more things!

- Made the bottom!
- Made all the ports on each side - God this took the longest
- Added power button.
- Coloured some more bits and bobs in.

- Redid all the ports because my pc bsod'd and I lost all the work I didn't save.

  God who knew making a laptop was gonna be soo hard, Now I'm off to making screw holes in the bottom of the laptop, then I'll be adding a keyboard and a trackpad, After that I'll be making some EXPANSION CARDS!!

# Let bro breathe

I added some vents! I also coloured them in. Colouring each vent was painfully hard.

# WHY TF IS THIS TAKING SOO LONG?

I spent one hour on this and I only made a trackpad and 4 keys, it took soo long because I made each of those 4 keys individually. I also coloured the inside, did some extruding of the trackpad and the little dip in the keyboard
